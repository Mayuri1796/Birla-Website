              The thematic curriculum for
              preschool draws on neuroscientific research, on how the brain learns naturally
              and which learning experiences are relevant at a particular age and stage in
              life. Developmental Appropriateness, Brain Compatible Learning and the theory of
              Multiple Intelligence guide the creatively designed curriculum for preschoolers
              to ensure learning for all children.

            <p class="paragraph1">The Curriculum for grades 1-4 is thoughtfully planned to ensure that each child
              at school enjoys these years in learning, discovery and creative engagement.
              Research on how the brain learns best, developmental appropriateness, the theory
              of Multiple Intelligences and the National Curricular Framework, 2005 have
              guided the planned curriculum.<br> Learning Environment is an affirmative and
              enabling one. Bright airy learning spaces, creative learning centres,
              comfortable reading nooks, integrated laboratories, ICT laboratories, exciting
              and interactive display boards, break out and break free zones and so on create
              an environment that catalyses learning. Assessment is continuous and
              comprehensive.<br> An ongoing process, it guides the learner in their pursuit of
              learning; also, a theme end summative assessment ensures timely feedback on
              degree of achievement of individuals as well as grade-level outcomes. These, in
              turn, guide teachers and parents to provide challenge or support, as per need,
              in a 'timely' and 'effective' manner.<br> The progress of each child is shared
              through detailed report books along with a portfolio of documented work making
              learning visible to all. All these thoughtful processes ensure the fulfillment
              of our ultimate goal of teaching in a way that all students learn.

            <p class="paragraph1">At Birla Open Minds International School, we emphasise on providing an inspiring
              school environment that enables a shift from rote methods to a course beyond
              textbooks.<br> The curriculum aims to provide experiences and opportunities for
              students to think differently, analyse and evaluate independently and foster a
              place where we can soften subject boundaries and connect knowledge to life
              outside the school.<br> The Middle School Curriculum at Birla Open Minds though
              unique, merges seamlessly with the ICSE/CBSE/IB/IGCSE boards. Till class 7,
              Birla Open Minds offers a unique Birla curriculum and Class 8 onwards the
              curriculum is designed keeping in mind the culminating Board examination.<br> The
              co-scholastic areas of the middle school gives the students the opportunity to
              express themselves - such as arts, drama, music, various individual and team
              sports and community service projects.<br> Life Skills and Physical Education and
              Outbound Programmes are also an integral part of the middle and high school
              curriculum.

            <p class="paragraph1">The Primary and Middle school approach of using experiential and student centric
              methodologies continues in the Birla Open Minds High School years. The
              transition is smooth and allows the students to prepare for the school leaving
              certificate examinations.<br> At the High School stage, the Birla Open Minds
              International Schools offer a variety of options to the students. The students
              can opt for the Indian boards such as the CBSE or the CISCE or can opt for the
              International Curriculum.<br> Students have the choice of opting for the ICSE/ CBSE
              or IGCSE curriculum in Grade 8.<br> In Grade 11, once again students have the choice
              of opting for the ISC/CBSE curriculum or the Cambridge A/AS levels.<br> All Open
              Minds school will be undertaking a feasibility study to consider applying for
              authorisation to offer the IBDP programme.<br>
